## ðŸ¤” Purpose of Developing the Plugin

To simplify the process of creating, archiving, and sorting sub-documents in SiYuan Note.

## âœ¨ Introduction to Plugin Features

Minimum required version of SiYuan Note for the plugin: v3.1.15

* Feature 1: Allows you to move documents referenced by all blocks in the current document, as well as those referenced by selected blocks (supports multi-selection and databases), to the sub-document path of the current document.

* Feature 2: Enables sorting of sub-documents based on the order of block references in the parent document.

  Previously, I developed a custom sorting enhancement plugin that could automatically sort documents by name and improve natural sorting, including sorting Chinese numeric titles. However, I wanted more flexibility. This plugin allows sorting based on the order of block references in the parent document, offering greater freedom in organizing sub-documents!

* Feature 3: Supports multi-selecting block content to quickly create sub-documents with block references. You can use list blocks to organize the hierarchy of sub-documents, and this plugin will help you quickly create them based on the list. The hierarchy of sub-documents will match the list's structure! Note that the plugin creates one document per paragraph block, so even if a block contains multiple lines, it will only create one document.
